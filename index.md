I can never answer the question, "Who Am I?" because all questions are created by the egoic mind. I Am Not My Mind.

[When the Buddha started to wander around India shortly after his enlightenment, he encountered several men who recognized him to be a very extraordinary being. They asked him: "Are you a god?" "No," he replied. "Are you a reincarnation of god?" "No," he replied."Are you a wizard, then?" "No." "Well, are you a man?" "No." "So what are you?" They asked, being very perplexed.  Buddha simply replied: "I am awake." Buddha means “the awakened one.” How to awaken is all he taught.](https://college.uchicago.edu/news/student-stories/i-am-awake#:~:text=Buddha%20simply%20replied%3A%20"I%20am,awaken%20is%20all%20he%20taught.&text=It%20was%20in%20search%20of,five%20centuries%20after%20Buddha%27s%20enlightenment)
